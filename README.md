# AOF-Face-Recognition

I would like to launch a piece of research on facial recognition that especially serves the AOF community. I will learn about the underlying mechanism of facial recognition (and machine learning algorithms that drives it) and the tools that are used to implement it. I will then try to train a model with pictures of members of the AOF community and write codes to recognize people in media including photos and videos. This model and tools I produce would be helpful for future projects like, for example, even more convenient check-in for school events by scanning faces. In addition, my code and model (but not any actual data from images of the school community) will be open-sourced on GitHub. Other people and their projects can benefit from what I have created. It would encourage our students to use what they have learned in class to do great contributions to the community.
